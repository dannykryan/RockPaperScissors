This game was originally created for the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' project, which was one of the first projects set in The Odin Project's full-stack JavaScript course.

I enjoyed the project so much that I developed it further so that the player must battle the evil 'Brainbot 9000' to save the earth from destruction!

It uses lots of emojis as illustrations and a system that prompts the user depending on their choices and progress - with some fun and sometimes snarky comments depending on how the player is doing!
